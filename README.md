Prerequisites: ryu, mininet, and behave

For the best results download the Virtual Machine Image with Ryu and Mininet following the steps here https://github.com/osrg/ryu/wiki/OpenFlow_Tutorial 

Once the virtual machine is ready and running it is time to install the Behave function
To do so run the command "pip install behave"
If you have any issues the guide can be found here http://pythonhosted.org/behave/install.html

Once you have all of this downloaded and running it is time to install my code.
